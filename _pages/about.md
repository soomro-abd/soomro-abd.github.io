:wave: Hey! I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (UMass) working with [Fatima Muhammad Anwar](https://people.umass.edu/fanwar/) and [Muhammad Taqi Raza](https://people.umass.edu/taqi/). My reseach focuses on building systems that lie at the intersection of **next-generation mobile networks, edge devices and AI**.

Right now, I am working on:

- improving federated learing (FL) over cellular networks

Previously, I have:

1. [very accurately synchronized time in NB-IoT devices]()
2. [found vulnerabilities in the `LinuxPTP` stack](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06421.pdf)
3. [secured timing systems in datacenters]()

Before UMass, I was an undergrad at the [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/) where I majored in Computer Science. I was also an undergraduate research assistant at the [Systems and Networks Lab (SysNet)](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~alizai/), under the supervision of [Hamad Alizai](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~alizai/) and [Naveed Anwar Bhatti](https://naveedanwarbhatti.github.io/). I worked with batteryless IoT devices and we designed [a framework for automating approximate computing!](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3715014.3722056)
